## Instruciton to run the program

* Here I have implemented the algorithm by splitting the program into three files, Main, Graph and Node classes. <br>
* To provide your inputs in a file, edit the '**inputs.txt**' file present in the Dijkstras_Algorithm directory.
* To compile Java files type ``` javac Dijekstras-Algorithm/*.java``` in the directory which contains the 'Dijkstras-Algorithm' directory.
* Execute the program by ```java Dijkstras_Algorithm.Main < Dijkstras_Algorithm/inputs.txt```. <br>
  This would produce the list of Node names along with their desired results.
